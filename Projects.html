                    AudioFile is a media player program that operates off of local user music media files. What differentiates
                    AudioFile from the other media player/streaming programs out there is it's dedication to immersing the user
                    fully in the music with web-scraping tools for music samples and guitar tabs depending on your active song
                    (maybe both if you're listening to Sublime). AudioFile also brings back the long lost visualization feature
                    from the days of Windows Media Player and expands upon this concept much deeper.

                    The Clean Building Performance Standard (CBPS) is an energy standard for commercial building owners over 50,000 SF
                    to adhere to in the State of Washington. Compliance is based on beating an energy performance metric (Energy Use Intensity Target or EUIt)
                    that may vary based on building type. CBPS Pro is an AI language model trained in the latest version of the CBPS legislation and is
                    developed from a pre-trained base model provided by the <a href="https://huggingface.co/">Hugging Face's</a> open source library. CBPS Pro is trained to help
                    commerical building owners and property managers understand the basics of CBPS rules and requirements.

                    Duct static pressure calculation is an essential yet nebulous task at times for most HVAC mechanical design engineers in new construction which determines
                    selection of fans, air handlers, and other expensive pieces of mechanical equipment that unfortunately can become "no going back now" items too early along in in the broader multi-discpline construction engineering
                    architectural design process. Most engineers use a combination of outdated ASHRAE software for static pressure calculation of specific fittings;
                    Excel for aggregation of fittings (AKA minor losses), straight lengths (AKA major losses), and rules of thumb for 'system effect' (this is where the black magic comes in). Duct Static Calc Pro
                    helps streamline the calculation process by combining these activities into a singular program with a modern user-friendly interface making things simpler
                    for HVAC/mechanical design engineers consequently the the multi-disciplinary design team effort.

                    Gym Workout App (tentative title) helps gym goers track their weightlifting statistics and exercise types in a free
                    and easy to use app. This app stands out from other pay-to-use apps in the sense that it is very streamlined for mobile applications and fluff free.
                    The best part is that it is free open-source software.

                    MTG Deck Builder is an application that helps you plan your next Magic: The Gathering deck based on basics such as color identity, format/gameplay variant, and mana curve theory.
                    It also uses AI insights and web scraping abilities to help build your deck based around more advanced concepts of theme, win condition, budget constraints. MTG Deck Builder can also help
                    generate deck codes for the online MTG Arena video game (assuming cards are available in Arena) to eliminate duplication of effort.
