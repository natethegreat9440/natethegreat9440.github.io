                <p>
                    Hi, if you are viewing this site it is likely because I either told you about it or you found it on my <a href="Resume">resume</a>
                    or LinkedIn page and are curious to learn more about me and my projects. In any case you are in the right place. Please refer to
                    the navigation links in the header section above or in the footer section below (they will take you to the same places) to learn more about the
                    active and completed programming related projects constituting my professional portfolio. This website itself is in fact one of my own personal
                    projects intended to demonstrate my web development skills in HTML and CSS.
                </p>
                <p>
                    In addition to my professional portfolio please feel free to check out my official resume (e.g., one-pager) page,
                    my Tools for Engineers page, and my Contact page if you would like to get ahold of me through this website.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Now with that business out of the way here is a quick bio about myself. My name is Nathan and I grew up in the great
                    Pacific Northwest state of Washington in the Greater Seattle Area. While I am open to remote work oppurtunities
                    I just can't leave this beautiful state and my friends and family behind for a relocation oppurtunity (so don't ask).
                    Right now I am ultimately seeking a role as a software engineer/developer for a progressive and innovative organization.
                    My interests vary and have evolved over time, so I like to keep an open mind in all things involving employment and beyond.
                </p>
                <p>
                    As a Washington State University graduate (computer science) with a B.S. in Mechanical Engineering computer science was not
                    necessarily my first career choice coming out of high school. However, computer science and programming was something that
                    did catch my interest at an even younger age through middle school and the majority of high school. It wasn't until my senior of
                    high school where I made the decision to put computer science on the back burner after taking a robotics class that my friend
                    Josh (check out his personal website <a href="https://kuroware.com/">here</a>) and I took and excelled in. The computer programming
                    classes offered at my high school were unfortunately very underdeveloped and lackluster, which also played into my decision to
                    take a different path. The path of mechanical engineering went well for me for a bit, but eventually it became something
                    that was no longer enjoyable the more I learned about the industry and the more I learned about myself. While in the academic and theoretical
                    sense I do still have a certain fondness for mechanical engineering, however after turning 30 and experiencing more than a few
                    personal revelations about what I am looking for in life and a career I figured I owed it to myself to pursue the path of computer
                    science and software engineering that I had once considered and abandoned over a decade ago.
                </p>
                <p>
                    My mind is still open to potentially merging the two paths if I were to find a role that would allow me to do so. Designing better CAD/BIM
                    software, load calc software, estimating software, and other general tools used in the HVAC/construction sub-discipline of mechanical
                    engineering would likely be a good fit for me considering my previous professional background in said industry as a design, sales, and energy engineer (seperate roles at seperate points in the early phase of my career).
                    However, as I mentioned my interests are broad and include other things that perhaps have no relevancy to mechanical engineering at all
                    such as music, video games, Magic: The Gathering, and excersice (i.e., running, soccer, and weightlifting). I am also a big fan of the outdoors and enjoy hiking, camping, and inner tubing.
