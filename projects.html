                                AudioFile is a media player program that works with local user music media files. What differentiates
                                AudioFile from the other media player/streaming programs out there is it's dedication to immersing the user
                                fully in the music with web-scraping tools for music samples and guitar tabs. AudioFile also brings back the long lost visualization feature
                                from the days of Windows Media Player and expands upon this feature.

                                Fifth release

                            <li>
                                Genius song samples and sampled by track info now added to display
                                <ul>
                                    <li>
                                        Uses Genius's API to retrieve this information where it exists for any given track once selected
                                        <ul>
                                            <li>Similar process of utilizing Render.com proxy web service for making calls to Genius's API</li>
                                        </ul>
                                    </li>
                                    <li>Sample info text boxes update based on searching status. I.e., Searching, Found, Not Found similar to the Genius Button</li>

                            </li>

                                Missing MP3 file tags now handled on load
                                <ul>
                                    <li>By default AudioFile uses the file name tags for a given uploaded MP3 file to set the Track Name, Artist, and Album fields</li>
                                    <li>If tags are not found AudioFile will attempt to use Genius's API to search for Track Name, Artist, and Album fields based on file name as a search query</li>
                                    <li>
                                        For best results it is recommended to have the file name in the format of "Track Number (##) - Track Name - Artist" or "Track Name - Artist"
                                        <ul>
                                            <li>Within this format it is fine to swap the positions of any of these fields in any order (i.e., "Artist - Track Name") as long as dashes are used as delimiters</li>
                                            <li>
                                                Failure to use a delimiter will produce low quality results. Often the algorithm will find something for any given file name, but it may be something completely unexpected
                                                <ul>
                                                    <li>If the algorithm finds nothing the fallback for loading the file will be to set the Track Name to the file name and set the artist and album to Unknown</li>
                                                </ul>

                                Duct static pressure calculation is an essential yet nebulous task at times for most HVAC mechanical design engineers in new construction which determines
                                selection of fans, air handlers, and other expensive pieces of mechanical equipment that unfortunately can become "no going back now" items too early along in in the broader multi-discpline construction engineering
                                architectural design process. Most engineers use a combination of outdated ASHRAE software for static pressure calculation of specific fittings and
                                Excel for aggregation of fittings (AKA minor losses), straight lengths (AKA major losses), and rules of thumb for 'system effect' (this is where the black magic comes in). Duct Static Calc Pro
                                helps streamline the calculation process by combining these activities into a singular program with a modern user-friendly interface making things simpler
                                for HVAC/mechanical design engineers and consequently the multi-disciplinary design team effort.

                                The Clean Building Performance Standard (CBPS) is an energy standard for commercial building owners with individual buildings over 50,000 SF
                                to adhere to in the State of Washington. Compliance is based on beating an energy performance metric (Energy Use Intensity Target or EUIt)
                                that may vary based on building type. CBPS Pro is an AI language model trained in the latest version of the CBPS legislation and is
                                developed from a pre-trained base model provided by the <a href="https://huggingface.co/">Hugging Faces</a> open source library. CBPS Pro is trained to help
                                commerical building owners and property managers understand the basics of CBPS rules and requirements.

                                It also uses AI insights and web scraping abilities to help build your deck around more advanced concepts of theme, win condition, and budget constraints. MTG Deck Builder can also help
                                generate deck codes for the online MTG Arena video game (assuming cards are available in Arena) to eliminate duplication of effort.
