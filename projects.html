                                AudioFile is a media player program that works with local user music media files. What differentiates
                                AudioFile from the other media player/streaming programs out there is it's dedication to immersing the user
                                fully in the music with web-scraping tools for music samples and guitar tabs. AudioFile also brings back the long lost visualization feature
                                from the days of Windows Media Player and expands upon this feature.

                                    <li>Queries Genius.com using Genius's API which allows you to grab links to song lyrics/info pages on Genius.com for a given track</li>
                                    <li>
                                        Clicking the Genius.com button once the API has found a link will take you to the page in your default browser

                                            <li>Link saves to the Track entry in SQLite database so program doesn't have to search for the same track again</li>

                                            <li>API Key is saved in Render.com so you still can't see if from this server code</li>

                            <li>Aside: Wanted to do something bigger than just this initially regarding fetching sample info from whosampled.com, however whosampled.com's TOS and lack of API access limited what I could do.</li>

                                <li>If whosampled.com allows more access to metadata in the future then who knows - maybe I'll pivot back and axe this feature. Until then the Genius button stays.</li>

                                The Clean Building Performance Standard (CBPS) is an energy standard for commercial building owners with individual buildings over 50,000 SF
                                to adhere to in the State of Washington. Compliance is based on beating an energy performance metric (Energy Use Intensity Target or EUIt)
                                that may vary based on building type. CBPS Pro is an AI language model trained in the latest version of the CBPS legislation and is
                                developed from a pre-trained base model provided by the <a href="https://huggingface.co/">Hugging Faces</a> open source library. CBPS Pro is trained to help
                                commerical building owners and property managers understand the basics of CBPS rules and requirements.

                                architectural design process. Most engineers use a combination of outdated ASHRAE software for static pressure calculation of specific fittings and
                                Excel for aggregation of fittings (AKA minor losses), straight lengths (AKA major losses), and rules of thumb for 'system effect' (this is where the black magic comes in). Duct Static Calc Pro
                                helps streamline the calculation process by combining these activities into a singular program with a modern user-friendly interface making things simpler
                                for HVAC/mechanical design engineers and consequently the multi-disciplinary design team effort.

                                MTG Deck Builder is an application that helps you plan your next Magic: The Gathering deck based on color identity, format/gameplay variant, and mana curve theory.
                                It also uses AI insights and web scraping abilities to help build your deck around more advanced concepts of theme, win condition, and budget constraints. MTG Deck Builder can also help
                                generate deck codes for the online MTG Arena video game (assuming cards are available in Arena) to eliminate duplication of effort.
