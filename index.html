                            Hi, if you are viewing this site it is likely because I either told you about it or you found it on my <a href="resume.html">resume</a>
                            or <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/nathanhaley/">LinkedIn page</a> and are curious to learn more about me and my projects. In any case you are in the right place. Please refer to
                            the navigation links in the header section above or in the footer section below (they will take you to the same places) to learn more about the
                            active and completed programming related projects constituting my professional portfolio. This website itself is in fact one of my own personal
                            projects intended to demonstrate my web development skills in HTML and CSS.
                        </p>
                        <br />
                        <p>
                            In addition to my professional portfolio please feel free to check out my official resume (e.g., one-pager) page,
                            my Tools for Engineers page, and my Contact page if you would like to get ahold of me through this website. Please also feel free to check out my <a href="https://github.com/natethegreat9440">Github profile</a>.
                        </p>

                            Now with that business out of the way here is a quick bio about myself. My name is Nathan and I grew up in the great
                            Pacific Northwest state of Washington in the Greater Seattle Area. While I am open to remote work oppurtunities
                            I just can't leave this beautiful state and my friends and family behind for a relocation oppurtunity at this time.
                            Right now I am ultimately seeking a role as an engineer for a progressive and innovative organization.
                            My interests vary and have evolved over time, so I like to keep an open mind in all things involving employment and beyond.
                        </p>
                        <br />
                        <p>
                            As a Washington State University graduate with a B.S. in Mechanical Engineering computer science was not
                            necessarily my first career choice coming out of high school. However, computer science and programming was something that
                            did catch my interest at an even younger age through middle school and the majority of high school. It wasn't until my senior year of
                            high school where I made the decision to put computer science on the back burner after taking a robotics class that my friend
                            Josh and I took and excelled in (check out Josh's personal website <a href="https://kuroware.com/">here</a>). The computer programming
                            classes offered at my high school were unfortunately underdeveloped and lackluster, which also played into my decision to
                            take a different path. The path of mechanical engineering has gone well for me, but after doing that for almost 10 years now I have felt the urge as of late to dive back into
                            computer science in order to broaden and enhance my current skillset. After turning 30 and experiencing more than a few
                            personal revelations about what I am looking for in a career I figured I owed it to myself to entertain the path of computer
                            science and software engineering that I had once considered and put off over a decade ago.
                        </p>
                        <br />
                        <p>
                            This was something I set out to do in September of 2024 through self-guided teaching and project-based learning.
                            This self-guided learning has allowed me within 6 months to pick up C#, Unity, HTML, and CSS and get started on the portfolio of projects you see on this website, which is an accomplishment that I am quite proud of.
                            I don't think I've been able to learn so much information so fast on any given subject in my life leveraging the power of AI and other great resources, but I do realize I am still scratching the surface of what is possible in the field of software engineering with today's technologies.'
                            Unfortunately with that being said, in the year 2025 the advanced proliferation of AI has been leading to mass layoffs in
                            the tech industry and the increasing entropy regarding the current US political and economic climate is making companies hesistant to hire. It would seem that trying to break into the software engineering field is more difficult than it's ever been at the moment.
                        </p>
                        <br />
                        <p>
                            At this point I am ultimately looking to merge the two paths of mechanical engineering and computer science if I were to find a role that would allow me to do so. Designing better CAD/BIM
                            software, load calc software, estimating software, HVAC controls software, and other general tools used in the HVAC/construction sub-discipline of mechanical
                            engineering would likely be a good fit for me considering my previous professional background in said industry as a design, sales, and energy engineer (seperate roles at seperate points in my career) and technical skills.
                            Outside of technical fields my personal interests are broad and include music, video games, Magic: The Gathering, and exercise (i.e., running, soccer, and weightlifting). I am also a big fan of the outdoors and enjoy hiking, camping, and inner tubing.
